# Use GitHub Copilot

To use GitHub Copilot as your language model provider:

1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension:

   - Open VS Code Extensions (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot"
   - Click Install

2. Sign in to GitHub Copilot:

   - After installation, you'll be prompted to sign in
   - Follow the authentication flow in your browser
   - Make sure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription

3. Verify Copilot is working:
   - Look for the Copilot icon in the status bar
   - It should show as connected (not greyed out)
   - Try using Copilot in a code file to confirm it's working

Once GitHub Copilot is properly set up, OpenTips will automatically detect and use it as the language model provider. No additional configuration is needed.

Note: If you prefer not to use Copilot, you can alternatively set up an Anthropic API key as described in the next section.
