OpenTips requires an operational Python service to provide tips. If OpenTips isn't able to setup this service automatically, you can configure it yourself:

- [Show Service Installation Guide](command:opentips.showServiceInstallationWalkthrough)

OpenTips requires a language model to generate suggestions:

- [Show Language Model Selection Guide](command:opentips.showLanguageModelWalkthrough)

OpenTips provides output channels where you can see logs and debug information:

- [OpenTips Output](command:opentips.openExtensionChannel): Log messages from the operation of the OpenTips extension.
- [OpenTips RPC Output](command:opentips.openRPCChannel): Logs from the `opentips` Python service.

If you aren't getting tips, check these output channels for messages that might help you diagnose the issue.
